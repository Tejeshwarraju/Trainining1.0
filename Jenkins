CD to the directory where you have the AWS key file (Eg: xxxx.pem)
Right click on the EC2 instance you created ,click on connect and  copy the text which resembles below

ssh - i KEYPAIR.pem PUBLIC DNS XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins-ci.org.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins

Find the public dns at thee lower pane of the EC2 instance

go to browser access url http://public_dns_instance:8080
